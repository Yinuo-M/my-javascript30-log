# what I learnt

- How to access user hardware through the navigator API and the navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints) method.
- More about the HTMLVideoElement, including the videoWidth and the videoHeight properties, and the "canplay" event.
- I became more familiar with the <canvas> element and I learnt how to take screenshots and manipulating the screenshots.

# outdated content from the tutorial

- We no longer need to convert a MediaStream object into an URL object in order to attach it to the src attribute of an <video> element. Nowadays this is deprecated, and we should attach the MediaStream object directly to the video by assigning it to video.srcObject
