# what I learnt

- Using break on -> attribute modifications to trace style changes back to the source code in chrome dev ool.
- Siblings and cousins of console.log
  - console.warn creates a warning message
  - console.error creates an error mes
  - console.assert tests assertions. If the first argument returns false, it writes an error message to the console with the message in the second argument.
  - console.clear closes the console
  - console.dir(obj) allows you to inspect the properties and methods of an object in the console. This is especially useful for elements.
  - console.count(label) counts the number of times console.count has been called with the label (String) supplied.
  - console.group indents following console messages, until console.groupEnd() is called. They must be called with the same label (String).
  - console.groupCollapsed is similar to console.group, except that it collapses following console messages.
  - console.time(label) tracks how long it takes until you call console.timeEnd with the same label.
  - console.table displays tabular data as a table. It takes one mandatory argument, which must be an array or an object.
