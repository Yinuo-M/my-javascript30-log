# my-javascript30-log
This is a log of my progress through Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 course. https://javascript30.com/

For each challenge, I upload my solution to the challenge before and after watching Wes's tutorial. I also briefly note down what I've learnt and what questions I still have in the notes document.
