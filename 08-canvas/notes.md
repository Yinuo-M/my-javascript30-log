# what I learnt

- How to use the HTML \<canvas> element and how to manipulate it using DOM, through the getContext() method. I learnt about the lineWidth, strokeStyle, lineJoin, and lineCap property, as well as the stroke(), beginPath(), moveTo() and lineTo() methods.
- I understood hsl better after playing with the hue property.
- I'm doing further reading on canvas on MDN to understand canvas better.
